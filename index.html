        <h2>What I do?</h2>
        <p> I've been using python and other tools to solve daily problems that I encountered. It's been useful and I realized I'm enjoying when I do this kind of tasks. Here I list some of them to get you a sense of what kind of problems and solutions were made.</p>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
          <li>Searching for a house // scraping the website and notification</li>
          <li>Slot reservation bot // to book the field as soon as available</li>
          <li>Speech to text // Transcripting all of the classes into text and ability to search keywords on what professor said about any subject or the exam :) </li>
          <li>Spotify playlists // Arranging too long and diverse playlists</li>
