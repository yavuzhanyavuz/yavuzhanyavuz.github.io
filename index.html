            <!-- End #lead-down The world is evolving fast, very fast. I know many people have been going through the feeling of falling behind, there are really too much content and development around us to keep up with. BUT, I believe there is also an opportunity in this. Institutions, regulations, companies and people are all in this cat and mice game. Some are leading with innovation and earns a competitive edge.
            My goal is to stay relevant with this data century we're living in and apply the knowledge I've developed over the years to solve problems. I, particularly, like working with data and transform its complex structure into a story that tells us something on how to move forward. In projects section, you can find some examples of me encountering with a problem and using technology & tools & recent developments to solve it. 
            <br>
            <br>

            I have a statistics, operations research and data science combined theoretical background but most of my practical knowledge and interests are self-taught, born out of curiosity.
            I believe that continuous learning is essential, not just because it keeps us relevant, but also because the enthusiasm it generates infuses joy and excitement into our lives. 

            In this data-driven era, technology is my instrument, and data, my canvas. Customers and stakeholders are still humans though. So I know communication will always be a permanent key.            
            -->
            I'm an analytics engineer/data analyst/data scientist (official title) in the aviation industry with a background in statistics, operations research, and data science. I focus on turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. Curious by nature, self-taught in many areas, and driven by a need to stay relevant in a fast-changing world. I care about both the numbers and the people behind them.

            The product was a video to report transcription tool that at first I needed for myself for my studies. Inputs are lecture recordings and outputs
            are word reports for each lecture that is consisted of transcription of the lecture and the slides that are shown during the lecture. Slides are detected by 
            image recognition algorithms of OpenCV and transcription is done by "whisper" package from OpenAI. They are linked by timestamps and everything is combined into a one word document in the end 
            that is generated by Python using the "python-docx" package. My hope was to sell it to students at KU Leuven but turns out, marketing and sales are quite difficult, even harder than building the product :)

            <p>
              This work is part of my master thesis at KU Leuven. 
              The objective was to scrape immoweb.be and create a dataset from the listings that will be used in EPC estimation and price prediction models.
              The scraper is written in Python and only by using requests package since data is retrieved by API calls. 
              Each day around ~1500 listings are added to the SQLite Database and currently >120,000 unique listings are stored.
              Scraper is automated and runs daily on my local computer.

            <p>
              The objective was to predict type of cuisine of a Michelin starred restaurant using pre labeled image data. It was a project of Big Data and Analytics course at KU Leuven.
              We've used Tensorflow and transfer learning from some pre-trained models(particularly Xception) on the image dataset. The course had 3 other projects similar to this that helped me acquire practical skills and modern tools in data science.

            <p>
              Leuven is notorious for its housing market and I had difficulty in finding a house as well. Kotwijs is the official website of KU Leuven for student housing. 
              I checked this website every day for 3 months. In the first month, it was manual and tedious. Then I decided automate it with a bot that checks for new listings and sends an email and push notification to me so I could
              be the first responder. I used Selenium because the website was dynamically loaded.

              Another real life problem that I could leverage technology to solve it. We were playing beach volley regularly back then but fields were always in high demand and got reserved in seconds, as soon as they were available.
              I know other people hated us but yes, robots are faster than humans. Great success!
